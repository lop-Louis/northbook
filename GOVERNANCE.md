# Project Governance (Automation & Drift Prevention)

## Purpose

Keep public documentation useful, safe, and small. Bots chase compliance; humans think strategically.

> Public-facing readers should use `docs/governance.md` (rendered on the site). This file adds internal-only automation, RACI, and SLO details so we do not duplicate guidance.

---

## Content Bands & Lifecycle

The public policy for Band A scope, lifecycle states, and frontmatter validation now lives in `docs/governance.md` (and the published site) under the **Anti-drift Content Governance** name. Instead of duplicating the rules here, treat that doc as the single source. This file simply adds operational context:

- **Band A:** Follow the public-facing [Band A reference](docs/band-a.md). Anything forbidden there is also forbidden here.
- **Lifecycle:** Apply the Draft→Review→Live→Watch→Stale→Archive model from `docs/governance.md`. This internal file only tracks the automation owners for each state.
- **Frontmatter + CTAs:** Use the required fields documented in `docs/governance.md`; CTA text now lives in the body via `data-primary-action` + `data-secondary-action` pairs, which drift prevention enforces.

Whenever you update those rules, update `docs/governance.md` first, then link back here if new context is needed.

## PR Gates (Automated Checks)

All pull requests undergo these automated checks:

### 🔴 Red (Blocking)

- Missing required frontmatter fields
- `band` set to anything other than 'A'
- Forbidden patterns detected (internal URLs, ticket IDs, secrets)
- Invalid `change_type` or `status` values
- Secret scan fails (gitleaks)
- Build fails

**Action:** PR is blocked until fixed

### 🟡 Yellow (Warning)

- File size exceeds `change_type` limit
- Broken external links detected
- TODO/FIXME markers in content
- Possible internal references flagged
- Owner format unusual (missing @)

**Action:** Requires one reviewer approval before merge

### 🟢 Green (Auto-merge)

- All checks pass
- No warnings
- Sanitization checklist complete

**Action:** Auto-merged within 1 minute via squash merge

---

## Drift Detection (Weekly)

Automated weekly scan on Mondays at 2 AM UTC checks for:

### Staleness Indicators

- **Age > refresh_after_days**: Page hasn't been updated within promised window
- **Broken links increased**: External link rot detected
- **No views in 90 days**: Analytics show no traffic (if enabled)
- **Severely stale**: 2x past threshold (flagged as priority)

### Automated Actions

1. Bot opens/updates "Stale Pages Report" issue
2. Pages marked `status: stale` in frontmatter
3. Bot creates PR with status updates
4. Stale banner displayed on affected pages
5. Issue auto-closes when all pages reviewed

### Manual Review Required

- Review content accuracy
- Update if needed
- Extend `refresh_after_days` if still valid
- Set `status: archived` if obsolete

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

| Metric                | Target    | Measurement           |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| Build success rate    | ≥ 99%     | Weekly aggregation    |
| Link errors per month | ≤ 5       | Lychee weekly scans   |
| Stale pages           | ≤ 10%     | Weekly stale report   |
| PR auto-merge (green) | < 2 min   | GitHub Actions timing |
| Security scan         | 100% pass | Every PR via gitleaks |

### Monitoring

- GitHub Actions workflow status
- Weekly stale report issue
- Monthly metrics review in team retrospective

---

## Stop Rules

### Immediate Halt (Red Flag)

**Any of these trigger deployment freeze:**

1. Security incident (leaked credentials, PII, secrets)
2. Legal/Brand violation flagged by leadership
3. Multiple build failures (>3 in 24h)
4. Critical link to malicious/inappropriate content

**Process:**

1. Pause all publishes (disable auto-merge)
2. Open security incident issue
3. Notify manager and security team
4. Investigate and remediate
5. Post-incident review before resuming

### Sunset Decision (Lack of Use)

**If after 60-day trial:**

- Zero or minimal page views (if analytics available)
- No questions answered via site links
- No community adoption

**Action:** Conduct retrospective, then either:

- Pivot to internal-only documentation
- Archive and redirect to alternative resource
- Extend trial with adjusted success metrics

- Monday 2 AM UTC: Stale page scan
- Monday morning: Dependabot updates

### Monthly (Manual)

- First week: Review stale report, close or extend
- Release tag: `site-YYYY.MM` with changelog
- SLO review in team retrospective

### Quarterly (Strategic)

## Change Process

### To This Document (GOVERNANCE.md)

1. Open PR with rationale
2. Requires approval from Manager (Policy Owner)
3. Notify team of changes
4. Update training materials if needed

## Measurement Policy

- North star: helpfulness ≥ 60% Yes over ≥ 100 views/month per page.
- Sanity: time to first answer, search-refine rate, dead-end exits.
- Action rule: any page under threshold gets needs-revision and an issue titled “Revise narrative: <page>” in the next train. Dead-end > 25% adds a top-of-page CTA before rewriting.

---

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

Every Playbook/Guide/Runbook page must include:

```yml
title: …
change_type: minor
band: A
audience: squad|leads|exec
tone: practical|coaching|policy
narrative_goal: resolve|decide|teach
primary_action: /runbooks/handover-20-min
review_after_days: 90
owner_role: chapter-lead
```

### CI enforcement:

- Presence (Milestone A).
- Allowed values + primary_action is an internal link (Milestone B).
