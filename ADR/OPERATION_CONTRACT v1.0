# Northbook Operations Contract v1.0

**Purpose**
Make the work predictable. Protect the North Star. Ship small, prove it, and keep receipts.

**Scope rule**
If a change is not covered by these guardrails and contracts, it is out of scope. The only path back in is a logged exception with owner, reason, expiry, rollback plan, and a measurable stop rule.

**North Star**
A visitor reaches the right doc and a runnable next action in under 60 seconds, for at least 80% of sessions across two consecutive weeks. Replace the numbers only via a decision entry.

**Owner and cadence**

* **Owner:** Louis [YOU]
* **Ops assist:** [BOT]
* **Cycle:** 14 days

**Baseline window and source**

* **Baseline window:** last 14 days
* **Source:** site analytics and PR log
* **Delta type:** money, risk, people capacity

**Invariants**

1. Default deny outside the guardrails.
2. Public Band‑A content only.
3. Runnable in 10 minutes is a hard gate for ops annex labs.
4. Exceptions expire automatically. No entry, no work.
5. One owner and date on every change.
6. Sanitize for public use before publish.

**Seams**

* UX research & content design
* UI delivery
* Tests and acceptance
* Governance and decisions
* Automation and CI

**Interfaces**

* UI → Tests: supplies acceptance checklist.
* UI → Governance: supplies guardrail mapping and decision link.
* Tests → Automation: supplies pass–fail signals.
* Automation → Governance: posts receipts and state.

**Change control**

* Single bet per cycle. Stop if receipts are flat or negative beyond the stop rule.
* Use "decision" entries for scope or metric changes.
* Pilot first for wide changes.

**Receipts**

* Adoption: pages touched and time to answer.
* Quality: lab pass rate and broken link count.
* Credibility: state page freshness and exceptions resolved on time.

**Stop rule**
If the North Star target misses for two cycles and exceptions increase, pause new features and run a 7‑day tighten pass focused on UI clarity, acceptance tests, and automation noise.

## Subcontract 1: UI Delivery

**Scope**
Create or change pages and components that help users find the answer and act within 60 seconds.

**Inputs**

* One sentence problem statement
* Mapping to a specific guardrail
* Decision link if scope or numbers change

**Outputs**

* Page with visible North Star line and CTA pair

**Invariants**

1. Plain opener plus two actions above the first section.
2. Exit metric sentence visible on page.
3. Links to State and Receipts visible.
4. Band and owner shown in frontmatter or header.

**Interfaces**

* Provide acceptance checklist to Tests.

* Exit metric sentence present.
* State and Receipts links present and live.
* Page usable without scripts.
* Runnable in 10 minutes for any annex lab.

**Risks and tripwires**

* Drift to marketing copy. Cut 20% if the fold gets crowded.
* Missing owner or band. Block until fixed.

**Stop rule**
If time‑to‑answer worsens by 10% after release, revert and fix the copy or IA before retrying.

**Lanes**

* **OWNER(@lop):** approve copy and IA changes, final publish.
* **OPERATOR** draft copy, check link health, assemble checklist.

---

## Subcontract 2: Tests and Acceptance

**Scope**
Define and run lightweight acceptance checks that protect the North Star without slowing delivery.

**Inputs**

* Acceptance checklist from UI
* Guardrail mapping from Governance

**Outputs**

* Pass–fail signals per page or change
* Lab artifacts for annex pages

**Invariants**

1. Three defaults always present: Runnable in 10, Contracts present when shared or risky, One‑line rollout and stop rule.
2. Tests describe user‑visible behavior, not internal frameworks.
3. Failures block merge unless a time‑boxed exception exists.

**Interfaces**

* Emit machine‑readable pass–fail to Automation.

**Stop rule**
If test flakiness exceeds 5% across two cycles, freeze new checks and simplify to the defaults.

**Lanes**

* **OWNER(@lop):** choose what is worth testing, approve exceptions.
* **OPERATOR** maintain checklists, run labs, file failures.

# Operational Addendum v1.1

## Subcontract 5: Scope Gate

**Purpose**
Stop scope creep at the door. Every change maps to a guardrail or carries a logged exception. Default deny.

**Inputs**

* PR with owner and date
* Guardrail mapping ID
* Exception entry when mapping is missing or broken

**Outputs**

* Pass or fail status with reason
* Label set: `in-scope` or `out-of-scope` and `exception-[id]`

**Invariants**

1. No mapping, no merge.
2. Metric changes require a decision entry.
3. Band and owner visible.
4. Single bet per cycle is respected.

**Interfaces**

* Governance for decisions and exceptions
* Automation to enforce gate
* UI and Tests to supply mapping and acceptance

**Rollout**

* Phase 1 manual checklist in reviews
* Phase 2 CI check for guardrail mapping and exception token
* Phase 3 auto-block on missing mapping

**Acceptance checks**

* Guardrail ID present
* Decision link present for metric changes
* Exception entry present and unexpired when used
* Owner and band present

**Risks and tripwires**

* Bypass via direct merge
* Noisy false fails
* Overly broad exceptions

**Stop rule**
If false fail rate exceeds 5% or cycle time increases by more than 15 minutes on average over two weeks, soften to manual and tune.

---

## Subcontract 6: Signal Registry

**Purpose**
Canonical list of signals we compute and display. Small, stable set that proves outcomes.

**Schema**

* id, name, description
* source and query reference
* refresh_after_days
* owner and steward
* weight and direction (up good, down good)
* thresholds and buckets
* kill_criteria and notes

**Initial set**

* Adoption: pages touched, time to answer
* Quality: annex lab pass rate, broken link count
* Credibility: state freshness, exceptions resolved on time

**Invariants**

1. ≤ 8 active signals.
2. Privacy and public safety sanitized.
3. Each signal has an owner and refresh SLA.
4. North Star has one leading indicator and one lagging receipt only.

**Interfaces**

* Automation computes and posts receipts
* Governance curates and sunsets
* UI consumes for state panels

**Rollout**

* Publish registry and a public page
* Post monthly snapshots with release tag

**Acceptance checks**

* Registry exists and validates
* Every signal shows owner and refresh date
* Latest snapshot linked from State
* At least one leading and one lagging mapped to the North Star

**Risks and tripwires**

* Metric creep and vanity graphs
* Stale signals that no one owns

**Stop rule**
If more than 8 signals or more than 25% are stale for 30 days, prune to the top 5 by decision value.

---

## Subcontract 7: Stewards for Scope, Signals, Exceptions

**Purpose**
Name who keeps the rails tight and visible.

**Roles**

* **Scope Steward:** validates guardrail mapping, runs Scope Gate, proposes scope decisions.
* **Signal Steward:** maintains registry, defines queries, checks freshness.
* **Exception Steward:** manages exception entries, expiries, and rollback confirmations.
* **OPERATOR** runs checks, posts receipts, flags expiries.

**Invariants**

1. One named steward per role plus a backup.
2. Steward names visible on the State page.
3. Conflicts of interest called out; steward cannot approve own exception.

**Interfaces**

* Governance lists stewards and backups
* Automation routes alerts to the right steward

**Acceptance checks**

* Stewards and backups listed with dates
* Alerts have an owner within 24 hours
* Exceptions closed or renewed before expiry

**Risks and tripwires**

* Steward bottlenecks
* Silent ownership drift

**Stop rule**
If any steward backlog exceeds one cycle or two expired exceptions linger, appoint acting steward and cut scope.

---

## Subcontract 8: Traceability Map

**Purpose**
Make the path from change to impact obvious. PR → Decision → Guardrail → Page → Signal → Receipt.

**Inputs**

* PR metadata and labels
* Decision and exception entries
* Signal registry
* Analytics snapshots

**Outputs**

* Machine-readable map for Automation
* Human page showing edges and orphans

**Invariants**

1. No orphan PRs; every merge links to a decision or exception.
2. Pages link to at least one signal.
3. Receipts reference the signal ids and the release tag.

**Interfaces**

* Automation builds and posts map
* Governance audits orphans
* UI uses map to place state links

**Rollout**

* Start with top 10 changes by impact
* Add weekly, keep the page under 1 screen of copy

**Acceptance checks**

* Coverage ≥ 90% of merged PRs in the last cycle
* Orphans listed and dated
* Example queries documented to trace any PR to receipts in under 3 clicks

**Risks and tripwires**

* Manual upkeep
* Overly clever diagrams that no one uses

**Stop rule**
If maintenance exceeds 30 minutes per week for two weeks, reduce to a table with three columns and drop diagrams.

---

## Subcontract 9: Attribution Rule

**Purpose**
Credit impact without overclaiming. Directional, time-bounded, receipts-backed.

**Rule**

* Default to team credit on receipts.
* When a single change is the clear driver, attribute primary credit to the change owner, secondary to the steward that enabled it.
* Use a baseline window and report ranges, not single points.
* Public phrasing stays directional: “contributed to,” “associated with,” “enabled.”

**Invariants**

1. Every attribution links to receipts.
2. No hero claims without a counterfactual window.
3. Limit to one primary owner per claim.

**Interfaces**

* Governance reviews attribution phrasing
* Automation attaches receipt links

**Acceptance checks**

* Receipt link present
* Baseline window stated
* Directional language used
* No more than one primary owner named

**Risks and tripwires**

* Metric gaming
* Social friction across teams

**Stop rule**
If more than one attribution dispute arises in a cycle, revert to team-only credit for that cycle and update rules next release.

---

## Subcontract 10: Freeze Protocol

**Purpose**
Pause changes when signals degrade or governance is breached. Fix fast, then unfreeze.

**Triggers**

* Time-to-answer worsens by ≥ 10% for two consecutive days
* More than three expired exceptions
* Link health shows > 5 criticals
* Test flakiness > 5% over a week
* Security or privacy breach indicators

**Steps**

1. Announce freeze with cause, owner, start time.
2. CI sets merge block except P0 hotfix and exception work.
3. Triage to the smallest reproducible seam.
4. Fix, verify against acceptance checks, and post receipts.
5. Close with exit criteria met and stop rule noted.

**Exit criteria**

* North Star back to baseline window
* Exceptions reduced to ≤ 1 and none expired
* Zero critical link failures
* Flakiness back under 5%

**Invariants**

1. Daily status during freeze.
2. No scope growth inside the freeze.
3. Postmortem entry with owner and date.

**Interfaces**

* Governance logs freeze and closure
* Automation enforces block and posts status

**Acceptance checks**

* Freeze log shows cause, timestamps, owner
* CI block verified
* Exit receipts posted and linked to signals

**Risks and tripwires**

* Frozen pipes used as an excuse to add scope
* Side-channel merges

**Stop rule**
If a freeze exceeds 7 calendar days without measurable improvement, escalate, cut scope by 30%, and re-run only the smallest slice with contracts visible.

## Subcontract 11: UX Research & Content Design

**Purpose**
Ensure the experience has evidence behind it and that information scent is obvious, so users reach the right doc and act within 60 seconds.

**Scope**
Problem discovery, hypothesis framing, IA, content design, low‑fi prototypes, and quick validation. No pixel‑polish here; that lives in UI Delivery.

**Inputs**

* One‑sentence problem statement and target audience
* Guardrail mapping and decision link when scope/metrics change
* Baseline window and success metric from North Star

**Outputs**

* Hypothesis note with evidence links
* IA change or content brief
* Prototype or copy draft ready for UI
* Acceptance checklist handed to Tests

**Invariants**

1. Evidence hierarchy: receipts › analytics › heuristic review › opinion.
2. Clarity over chrome: plain language, verb‑first CTAs, no jargon.
3. Accessibility baseline: WCAG 2.2 AA intent preserved in copy and IA.
4. Information scent: primary task visible in first screen with two or fewer competing choices.
5. Privacy: do not collect new personal data to run a UX check.

**Interfaces**

* → UI Delivery: content brief, IA diff, prototype, and acceptance checklist.
* → Governance: guardrail mapping, decision links, and exception needs.
* ↔ Signals: define or adjust leading indicator queries with the Signal Steward.
* → Tests: task protocol for a 10‑minute UX lab.

**Rollout**

* Pilot on the top entry page by traffic. Use a 10‑minute five‑task micro‑lab or five‑second test. If time‑to‑answer improves, extend.

**Acceptance checks**

* Hypothesis note links to baseline and target.
* IA or copy diff attached and traceable to a guardrail.
* Prototype/copy covers opener + two actions and includes an exit metric sentence.
* Task success ≥ 4 of 5 participants or equivalent heuristic pass.
* Accessibility intent intact; no loss in heading structure or link clarity.

**Risks and tripwires**

* Over‑research slowing delivery. Cap to two hours per change.
* Style drift. Enforce content brief and terminology list.
* Confounding releases hiding impact. Coordinate with Release tag.

**Stop rule**
If UX work adds more than 15 minutes to average cycle time for two weeks without improving time‑to‑answer or task success, pause new UX changes, keep the highest‑leverage IA fix only, and re‑evaluate signals.

**Lanes**

* **OWNER(@lop):** approve hypotheses affecting scope or signals; sign off IA changes.
* **OPERATOR** draft content briefs, run micro‑labs, compile receipts and handoffs.
