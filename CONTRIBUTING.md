## Creating a Page

2. Add required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Practice
band: A
owner: '@your-github-handle'
refresh_after_days: 90
change_type: patch
status: live
---
```

3. Write content (Band A only!)

4. Test locally:

```bash
npm run guard        # Check compliance
npm run docs:dev     # Preview
```

## Common Issues

### Guard Fails with "Missing Frontmatter"

Add all required fields:
```yaml
---
title: Required
band: A
owner: '@required'
refresh_after_days: 90
change_type: patch
status: live
---
```

### Guard Fails with "Band Not Allowed"

Ensure `band: A` (exactly, capital A).

### "Possible Internal Reference"

Remove:
- Internal URLs (intranet, corp domains)
- Ticket IDs (JIRA-1234)
- Company/product names
- Exact numbers (use ranges)

### Build Fails

Check for:
- Broken links in markdown
- Invalid Vue syntax in frontmatter
- Missing images

---

## Code Style

### Markdown

- Use ATX headers (`# Title`, `## Section`)
- Code blocks with language tags
- Links to other docs as relative paths

### Frontmatter

- YAML format
- Lowercase keys
- Quoted strings for special chars

---

## Review Process

### Green PRs (Auto-merge)
- All checks pass
- No warnings
- Valid Band A content

### Yellow PRs (Review Required)
- Large changes for declared `change_type`
- Possible internal references detected
- Broken external links

### Red PRs (Blocked)
- Missing frontmatter
- Invalid band value
- Secret scan fails
- Build fails
