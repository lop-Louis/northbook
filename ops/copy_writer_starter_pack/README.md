# Copywriter starter templates · Northbook page archetypes

These four templates exist so you never have to guess what a "Navigate" or "Operate" page is supposed to do. Each one:

- Keeps the opener pattern intact: one-line why, two actions, one exit metric.
- Respects readers as adults: guidance, not orders.
- Makes your work traceable to real outcomes (time-to-answer, labs, freezes, etc.).

Use them as a starting point. Replace the bracketed pieces with your own words, keep the structure.

Tone guardrails when you write

When you fill these in, keep CTAs inside this small pool so pages feel calm and consistent:

`try`, `use`, `choose`, `see example`, `compare`, `preview`, `adapt`, `learn more`, `start`, `open`, `review`, `explore`, `share`, `log`.

Avoid command language like "must", "ASAP", "urgent", "no excuses", "best practice", or "mandatory". If you feel tempted, rewrite it as a choice, a trade‑off, or a safeguard instead.

## 1. Navigate archetype · Help people choose a path

**file**: [./page_archetype_navigate.md](./page_archetype_navigate.md)

Use this when the reader is asking: _"Where do I start? Which option is sane for me?"_

### Copy hints for Navigate (for you, not the reader):

- Keep the **What this page is for** line under 25 words.
- Name the trade‑offs in human language: "speed vs confidence", "short‑term vs long‑term", not buzzwords.
- Make sure each action leads somewhere specific and reversible.

## 2. Operate archetype · Smallest runnable path to outcome

**file**: [./page_archetype_operate.md](./page_archetype_operate.md)

Use this when the reader is asking: _"How do I actually do this, without breaking anything?"_

### Copy hints for Operate (for you, not the reader):

- Open with **what becomes easier** after following this page, not with tools or frameworks.
- Keep steps short and testable; if you cannot describe the example in one screen of text, split it.
- Make rollback feel normal, not like an admission of failure.

## 3. Learn archetype · Show what moved and what did not

**file**: [./page_archetype_learn.md](./page_archetype_learn.md)

Use this when the reader is asking: _"Did this change actually help, and what should we do next?"_

### Copy hints for Learn (for you, not the reader):

- Write like you are talking to a busy lead: "Here is what moved, here is what did not, here is the call I recommend."
- Separate **facts** from **interpretation**. Facts first, then what you think they mean.
- Name uncertainty honestly. "This suggests…" is better than fake certainty.

## 4. Mitigate archetype · Contain damage without selling the star

**file**: [./page_archetype_mitigate.md](./page_archetype_mitigate.md)

Use this when the reader is asking: _"Something is off. How do we pause safely and get back to normal?"_

### Copy hints for Mitigate (for you, not the reader):

- Speak plainly about risk. Readers are already worried; they do not need spin, they need clarity.
- Make ownership visible: name who is responsible for calling the freeze and for closing it.
- End with a short learning note so the page feels like support, not blame.

## How this reflects people leadership

All four archetypes are written so a contributor can:

- See the **promise** of the page in one sentence.
- Choose between at least two sane, reversible actions.
- Understand what "good" looks like in terms of exit metrics and receipts.

Your job as a leader is to keep the structure and let people shape the words. If they keep the opener, the two actions, and the exit metric, they are inside the guardrails.
