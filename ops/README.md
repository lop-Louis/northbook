# Operator starter pack

Purpose: internal templates and stubs that make the contract runnable. Do not publish directly.

## How to use

1. Copy the relevant template into your working page.
2. Replace placeholders inside `{{ like_this }}`.
3. Keep all IDs lowercase. Tags use `vyyyy.mm-<seam>` (example `v2025.11-navigation`).

## Included

- Canonical IDs sheet
- Decision and exception templates
- Enforcement ladder summary
- Tone lint config (allow/ban lists + thresholds)
- CI rule map (what blocks vs nudges)
- Signal registry seed (≤ 8 signals)
- Redirect ledger stub + legacy banner
- Receipts + state snapshot templates
- Page archetypes for navigate/operate/learn/mitigate
- Dashboard home stub
