# Move irrelevant docs to `/draft` and exclude from build/search

Park low-value or out-of-scope pages in a quarantined `/draft` area so pilots focus on actionable guidance without deleting history. This decision is final and pairs with the refreshed [Northbook Operations Contract](../contracts/northbook-operations-contract-v1.md).

## context

Irrelevant or stale docs dilute search, confuse receipts, and slow the pilot without contributing to the North Star. We need a reversible quarantine that does not require new tooling, keeps traceability intact, and still lets us restore a page quickly if its owner proves the value.

### invariants (carry-over)

- No CI/tooling changes in v0.1. Use existing page-scan, docs:guard, VitePress ignore, and search ignore lists.
- Traceability never breaks. Every move records an owner, reason, and binds to a stable id in `/ops`.
- Guidance over gate: block only when required annotations or commitments are missing (L4 rule). Everything else is a warning or receipt-level nudge.

## decision

Move every doc classified as **irrelevant for v0.1** into `/draft`, ensure it is excluded from build/search, and record the move on the next release tag with receipts linking the prior location and justification. The move is reversible; the receipts log plus `/ops` binding is the source of truth.

Tradeoffs:

- We accept a temporary increase in bookkeeping (annotating each move) to avoid deleting history.
- Search noise drops immediately because `/draft` stays out of the build, but contributors must fetch content from history when they want to reuse it.
- No new tooling keeps risk low, but manual receipts work requires discipline across releases.

## scope

**In scope:** All public docs under `/docs` during the v0.1 pilot that meet at least one of these rules:

1. **Out-of-scope topic** – the content does not map to a live bucket, guardrail, or active contract.
2. **Stale owner** – no current owner or date in frontmatter and no refresh commitment.
3. **Unrunnable guidance** – cannot be executed within 10 minutes or lacks a measurable CTA path.
4. **Duplicative** – overlaps another page where the canonical source is already tagged.

**Out of scope:** system docs already hidden (legacy, sandbox), legal/compliance docs with separate retention commitments, and annex labs currently under an exception.

## acceptance

- Moves use only the existing guardrails (`docs:guard`, page-scan, VitePress ignore) and do not add CI steps.
- Every moved page keeps `owner`, `date`, `bucket_id`, `page_id`, adds `decision_id: dec-2025-11-draft-move`, a single-sentence `move_reason`, and a `receipts` reference to the release tag entry.
- `/ops` entries bind the stable id to the move receipt so traceability never breaks.
- Page-scan reports zero broken links and no more than one redirect hop from the former URL.
- The release tag lists each move with its `move_reason`, old path, and new `/draft` path.
- Bucket indices show a net reduction of irrelevant surface without breaking a required CTA path.

## receipts (expected)

- **Leading:** `m-search-noise` <= baseline within one tag; `m-link-warnings` stays at zero after the move.
- **Lagging:** `m-time-to-answer` improves >= 10% by the second tag after the move; `m-draft-restore-rate` <= 10% over two cycles (few reversals).
- Attach receipts to `site-v2025.11` and subsequent seam tags.

## freeze and exit

Freeze new moves if any of these fire:

1. Broken-link count > 0 or redirect hops > 1 for a moved page.
2. Release tag misses a receipt entry for any move.
3. Search noise worsens >= 10% over baseline for 7 consecutive days.

Exit the freeze once receipts show the offending metric back within 10% of baseline for 7 days, all missing receipts are posted, and the owner revalidates the `/draft` quarantine list.
