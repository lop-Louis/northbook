# Stale Pages Report

This issue is automatically generated by the weekly stale page audit workflow.

## Pages Requiring Review

<!-- Auto-populated by workflow -->

## Actions Required

For each stale page:
1. **Review** the content for accuracy
2. **Update** if needed, or confirm it's still valid
3. **Extend** `refresh_after_days` in frontmatter if content is current
4. **Archive** by setting `status: archived` if content is obsolete

## Automation

- This issue is created/updated every Monday at 2 AM UTC
- Pages exceeding their `refresh_after_days` threshold are marked `status: stale`
- A bot PR will be opened to update frontmatter
- This issue closes automatically when no stale pages remain

---

💡 **Tip**: Keep `refresh_after_days` realistic based on how often the topic changes.
