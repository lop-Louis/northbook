# Monthly Release Rhythm

This cadence keeps the public docs fresh each month and records what changed. <a href="#goals" data-primary-action>Run the prep checklist</a> or <a href="./runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>.

- Support governance reviews with transparent change log

## Tag Format

```
site-vYYYY.MM
```

Example: `site-v2025.11`

## When

- First business day of each month
- Skip tag if no substantive changes (patch-only changes OK to roll up)

## Preparation Checklist

1. Merge outstanding approved PRs
2. Run `npm run guard` (no red failures)
3. Run `npm run docs:build` (build success)
4. Review stale report and address critical items
