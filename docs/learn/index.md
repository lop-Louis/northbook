## What is live in Learn

- **Signals roster** — roster freshness and “do people leave with a next step.”  
  → [Open signals roster](./signals-roster)

Use it before ops sessions and after them. More write-ups can wait.

If the signals view is unclear, open a PR or note and tag the steward roster contact.
