  How we watch the pilot’s health and turn two simple signals into small, real changes.

Use this page when you want to **see what we are learning** from how the chapter runs, not just what we planned.

> **Expected Takeaway:** you leave knowing which simple signal to look at to understand how the chapter feels right now.

## What “Learn” means in this pilot

Long term, “Learn” could host many write-ups and dashboards.

For this pilot, we keep it small:

- one page that tracks two health checks
- stories and observations shared in chapter ops sessions

The goal is to notice patterns early, not to build a giant report.

## The two health checks

Open the **signals roster** to see:

- how current our chapter roster is
- how often people leave sessions with a clear next step

> [Open signals roster](./signals-roster)

These are not performance scores. They are checks on whether our routines are helping or getting in the way.

## How to use this lane

If you are:

- **preparing for a chapter ops session**: glance at the signals so you know where to ask questions
- **leaving a session**: notice whether you have a clear next step, and say so if you don’t

Over time, the Learn lane may grow into short write-ups of what worked. For now, the signals roster is enough to keep us honest.
