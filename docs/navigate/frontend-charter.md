  What the frontend chapter is for, what it is not for, and when to bring something here instead of
  to your squad.
---

Use this page when you need a quick answer to one question:

> What is this frontend chapter actually for, and what is it not for?

- Start here when you are unsure whether something belongs in the chapter or in your squad.
- Try the ops defaults if you need a concrete way to use this in your next 1:1 or ops session.

**Expected Takeaway:** a new chapter member can explain what this chapter is for and not for in under 60 seconds after reading.

## Scope line

The frontend chapter exists to **keep frontend skills and standards healthy across squads, name clear owners for important topics, and give you a fair, transparent way to talk about your lane and growth.**

If you care about doing good frontend work without constantly guessing who to talk to or what "good" looks like, this space is for that.

## What this chapter is here to do

This chapter is here to:

- Align on **frontend competency** across squads, so foundations and patterns stay coherent.
- Make it clear **who owns which important frontend topics**, so questions don’t bounce around.
- Provide a **fair baseline** for talking about lanes, expectations and growth.
- Keep a **shared map in Northbook** so decisions do not disappear into chat history.

You can use this chapter to surface patterns that affect more than one squad, and to get help when your lane or direction feels fuzzy.

## What this chapter is **not**

To keep trust and focus, this chapter is not:

- A command center that tells squads what to build or how to run their rituals.
- A place to park every problem you have with work.
- A replacement for HR, salary talks or performance processes.
- Group therapy. People matter, but this space has a job.

Squad work stays for squad decisions. The chapter is where we agree on **frontend backbone, ownership and competency**.

## When to bring something to the chapter

Use the frontend chapter when:

- The topic affects **more than one squad** (design system use, shared components, frontend standards).
- You are **not sure who owns** a frontend topic and need a clear DRI.
- You want a **fair conversation about your lane or growth** in frontend, not just your current squad tasks.
- You see a pattern that keeps repeating (for example: same UI bug across teams, same confusion about tokens, same onboarding gap).

Keep it in your squad when:

- It is about **local delivery**, specific to your backlog or release.
- It is a **one-off issue** that does not signal a wider pattern.

Default rule:

> If it touches multiple squads, ownership or long‑term frontend health, it probably belongs in the chapter.

## What you can expect from the chapter lead

From the chapter lead hat, you can expect:

- Help to **name and adjust lanes** so people are not stuck in the wrong place.
- Support in **naming DRIs** for important frontend topics.
- A push to keep Northbook updated enough that you don’t have to guess where to look.
- Honest conversations about constraints, not empty promises.

If something feels unfair, unclear or "rigged", raising it here is part of the job, not a problem.

## What the chapter asks from you

From you, as a chapter member, this space needs:

- Honesty about where you are strong now and where you want to grow.
- When you own a topic, acting like the go‑to person, not a silent expert.
- Signals, not just feelings: links, examples, receipts of what is working or not.
- A nudge when Northbook is out of date, so the map stays real.

You do not have to be loud. You do need to be truthful.

## Scope line at a glance

Use this quick scope line when routing work:

- **In:** removing ambiguity around frontend-adjacent work, keeping shared baselines current, and posting receipts for the two live signals.
- **Out:** HR performance calls, salary ladders, or long-form research that belongs in a squad or people team lane.

If something feels in-between, flag it instead of letting it drift. The ops defaults give you three simple scope tests: reduce ambiguity, protect focus, publish receipts. If a topic fails those tests, change the lane.

## When to exit or reroute

If a request fails the scope tests:

- move it to a squad backlog with a named owner/date, or
- log an exception with owner, expiry (≤ 30 days), rollback path, and stop rule so Governance can track the detour.

Most exceptions go into the [cloud-access stub](../mitigate/exception-cloud-access.md); future stubs will follow the same pattern.

## How we know this is working

Over two review cycles we look for two simple signals:

- **Roster freshness:** at least 9 out of 10 active members have their baseline row current.
- **Direction after conversations:** at least 8 out of 10 people leave Operation-mode sessions knowing their next step.

Those checks live on the [signals roster](../learn/signals-roster.md) and its receipts, not on this page, so you always have one place to update the numbers.

## Where to go next

If you are using this page, these are the next steps:

- **Meeting defaults:** try the ops defaults for "Casual" vs "Operation" and the 1:1 fallback.
- **Signals:** see the roster signals we use to check whether this baseline is actually working.

This keeps the chapter small, honest and usable: a clear scope line here, practical defaults in ops, and visible signals for whether people feel they have direction.
