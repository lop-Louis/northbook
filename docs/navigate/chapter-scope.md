> **Heads-up:** The canonical scope page is now [Frontend chapter · scope line](./frontend-charter.md). This archived copy sticks around for historical reference. Start there unless you were sent here for comparison.

Use this scope line when a request seems fuzzy. [Try the ops defaults](../operate/ops-defaults-meetings.md) or [Open the roster signals](../learn/signals-roster.md) to keep the loop tight.

# What this page is for

This page helps Web Frontend chapter members decide whether their next move belongs in the shared ops lane or in squad work by making the scope line—and its exits—visible in one calm stop. If something feels in-between, flag it and we will sort it together rather than letting it linger.

## What you can do here

- action 1: try the ops defaults — check your topic against the scope tests (reduce ambiguity, protect focus, publish receipts) and send it through the Operation cadence if it qualifies.
- action 2: open the roster signals — open the roster plus signals view to confirm owners, `best_lane_now`, and whether your item already has a stewarded next step.

### Scope line

**In:** removing ambiguity around frontend-adjacent work, keeping shared baselines current, and posting receipts for the two live signals.  
**Out:** HR performance calls, salary ladders, or long-form research that belongs in a squad or people team lane.

### When to exit

If a request fails the scope tests, move it to a squad backlog or log an exception with owner, expiry (≤ 30 days), rollback, and stop rule so Governance can track the detour.

## How we’ll know it’s working

Within the first month, folks stop guessing where to route work.  
Over two review cycles:

- At least 9 out of 10 “baseline” rows stay current so the roster answers the next step for them.
- At least 8 out of 10 people say they know where to look for direction before escalating.
