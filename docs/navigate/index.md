  How the Navigate bucket works in this pilot and what belongs here instead of Operate, Learn, or
  Mitigate.
---

In this pilot, it does one simpler job:

- help you find the **few** ops pages that are actually in play for the web frontend chapter

We keep the navigation surface small on purpose so it stays honest and easy to use.

<PageCTA />

> **Expected Takeaway:** you leave with one page to open next, not a list of ten.

## Quick links for the web frontend pilot

<PilotPageList bucket="navigate" />

## Common situations

### “I just joined / I’m catching up”

Start with the **chapter state**:

- see what the pilot is currently testing
- see which ops pages matter right now

> [Open chapter state](../changelog/state/web-frontend)

### “I’m not sure who owns this kind of problem”

Go to the **steward roster**:

- find who to tap for scope, signals, or exceptions
- check if there is a backup if the primary steward is busy

> [Open steward roster](../operate/stewards)

### “I want to see the health checks”

If you care about how the chapter is doing over time, open the **signals roster**:

- roster freshness
- whether people leave sessions with a clear next step

> [Open signals roster](../learn/signals-roster)

## If you are still unsure

If none of these fit your situation, pick the closest one and bring the mismatch as a story.

Navigation in a pilot is allowed to be rough; what matters is that you can find a person or page to talk through it with.
