Find the one page you need for the web frontend pilot. Everything else is out of scope for now.

<PageCTA />

## Open one of these and move

<PilotPageList bucket="navigate" />

## Common situations

### “I just joined / I’m catching up”

Open **chapter state** for the snapshot, what is active, and what to read before ops time.

> [Open chapter state](../changelog/state/web-frontend)

### “I’m not sure who owns this kind of problem”

Go to the **steward roster** for scope, signals, or exception owners and backups.

> [Open steward roster](../operate/stewards)

If navigation feels off, open a PR/note and tag the steward roster contact.

### “I want to see the health checks”

Open **signals roster** to see roster freshness and “do people leave with a next step.”

> [Open signals roster](../learn/signals-roster)

## If you are still unsure

Pick the closest page and flag the mismatch. The pilot surface is intentionally small.
