# Accessibility audit runbook

Run this quarterly sweep before release windows to keep public docs accessible. [Start the audit](#purpose) or [Browse the runbooks index](./runbooks-index).

## Purpose

Quarterly accessibility sweep for public Northbook pages. Logs reside in repo history; avoid calendar specifics for public neutrality.

## Evidence template

Copy this into your audit doc each quarter:

```
Audit date: YYYY-MM-DD
Preview URL: https://preview-host.example
Pages tested: Home, Decision Spine, Accessibility Quick Wins, Runbooks index
Lighthouse scores: P:XX / A:YY / B:ZZ / SEO:AA
Manual findings:
- [ ] Heading levels sequential (list any violations)
- [ ] Focus ring visible on buttons
- [ ] Images with descriptive alt text
Tickets opened: #123, #124
```

## Notes

- Run Lighthouse in an incognito window to avoid extensions skewing results.
- If new components ship (e.g., custom nav, accordions), add them to the tested page list.
- At least once per half-year, pair with an assistive tech user for a qualitative check.
