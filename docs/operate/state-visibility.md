# State visibility map

Stop guessing whether work is stuck—let this map show the state, entry signal, and SLI guardrail for every stream. [Publish your state map](#state-table) or [Browse the runbooks index](./runbooks-index). Pair this with a weekly 15-minute review so deviations surface fast.

> Latest release bundle: [`ops/releases/2025-11/index.md`](../../ops/releases/2025-11/index.md) summarises decisions, signals, and receipts for the current cycle.

## State table

| State        | Entry signals (what must be true)                                                | Exit signals (what closes the state)                                      | SLI                                            |
