# Runbooks

This index keeps the chore-heavy flows out of the softer guidance pages. [Jump to the runbook stack you need](#handoffs) or [Flag a missing runbook](https://github.com/lop-Louis/go-to-docs/issues/new?labels=kl,feedback&title=%5BFeedback%5D%20Runbooks%20index&body=Page:%20https://northbook.guide/operate/runbooks-index).

Every runbook follows the [Anti-drift Content Governance](../governance.md) rules—sanitize identifiers before you paste receipts.

## Handoffs & transitions {#handoffs}

- [20-minute handover drill](./handover-20-min.md) — Force clarity and move a stream from Framing to Ready in one sitting.
- [Handover RACI template](./handover-raci-template.md) — Capture who runs what when ownership shifts.
- [Transition operating promises](./transition-operating-promises.md) — Document the promises that keep multi-team transitions aligned.

## Ritual kits

- [Community meeting pack](./community-pack.md) — Agenda, prompts, and follow-ups for recurring community syncs.
- [Accessibility audit runbook](./accessibility-audit.md) — Scope, checklist, and receipts for full-audit weeks.

## Visibility & metrics

- [Shared metric visibility](./shared-metric-visibility.md) — Publish shared KPIs with context and owners.
- [State visibility map](./state-visibility.md) — Show every work stream’s entry/exit signals plus the SLI tied to it.

## Quality gates & hygiene

- [Link integrity runbook](./link-integrity.md) — When Quick-Run isn’t enough, this walks you through fixing broken anchors at scale.

Need a quick pre-flight before you drop into these flows? Run the [Quick-Run](../navigate/quick-run) first; escalate here only if that guard still fails.
