# Transition operating promises

These templates keep transition approvals, escalations, and cadences explicit. [Codify your operating promises](#approvals-template) or [Browse the runbooks index](./runbooks-index). Pair them with the [Handover RACI template](./handover-raci-template.md) so every role knows the service level they own during a transition.

## Approvals template

Fill this table before the handover call so nobody waits for ad-hoc green lights.

| Condition                                  | Action                                                                 | Primary owner                     | Time box / SLA  | Backup            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Scope change increases effort by >1 sprint | Revalidate scope, align on tradeoffs, capture delta in ledger          | Transition decider (Product lead) | 2 business days | Engineering lead  |
| New risk rated Sev-2+ surfaces             | Triage with receiving team, confirm mitigation owner, update stop rule | Facilitator                       | Same day        | On-call EM        |
| Resource gap longer than 3 business days   | Trigger staffing request, pause handover until backfill is confirmed   | Delivery lead                     | 24 hours        | Program manager   |
| Policy questions outside Band A            | Escalate to governance owners, log answer in FAQ                       | Doc steward                       | 48 hours        | Governance backup |

## Escalation path

When a promise is violated, the on-call should know exactly who to page.

| Breach                         | First escalation                              | Second escalation | Auto-stop rule                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SLA missed by >24h             | Delivery lead pings facilitator + owning lead | Program sponsor   | Pause transition until next review                                                                               |
| Risk not acknowledged in 48h   | Facilitator pings governance owner            | VP sponsor        | Strip scope to minimum viable handover                                                                           |
| Docs or runbooks lack receipts | Doc steward pings contributor                 | Governance owner  | Block release tag until [Quick-Run](../navigate/quick-run) + [Link Integrity](./link-integrity.md) receipts land |

## Status cadence

| Signal                    | Audience                      | Channel                         | Owner           | Notes                                                                                                 |

| Release-ready review      | QA, doc steward, product lead | Live call + notes               | QA lead         | Run [Quick-Run](../navigate/quick-run) + [Link Integrity runbook](./link-integrity.md) before closing |

## Communication promises

- **Everyone gets the same story** — Publish the status snapshot in the same doc you use for RACI, never in DMs.
- **Receipts or it didn’t happen** — Every action item references a runbook section or screenshot.
- **“Stop the line” stays literal** — Anyone can pause the transition if a promise is at risk; log the pause in the transition doc.

## After the handover

1. Archive the fulfilled promises in the [State ledger](../navigate/state-ledger.md) with the release tag.
2. Note any exceptions or escalations in the [Link Integrity runbook](./link-integrity.md) if they affected docs.
3. Update the [Fast support index](../support/) if new interrupts surfaced during the transition.
4. Review this page every 6 months—promises that no one owns should be removed or reassigned.
