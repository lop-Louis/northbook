Keep guidance consistent without adding chores. [Open the playbook page you need](#playbook-pages) or [Give feedback on the playbook](https://github.com/lop-louis/go-to-docs/issues/new?labels=kl,feedback&title=%5BFeedback%5D%20Playbook%20index&body=Page:%20https://northbook.guide/operate/).

These entries inherit the [content governance rules](/governance) so readers recognize layout, tone, and CTA placement at a glance.

## Playbook pages {#playbook-pages}

- [Guides vs rules](./guides-vs-rules.md) — Classify whether something is advisory or mandatory.
- [Handshake contracts](./handshake-contracts.md) — Frame promises and acceptance criteria before collaborating across seams.
- [RACI by seams](./raci-by-seams.md) — Assign ownership using the seam-first model.
- [Stop rules](./stop-rules.md) — Define the tripwires that pause or stop work when promises are at risk.
- [Scoreboard](./scoreboard.md) — Publish baselines, targets, cadence, and accountability in one card.
- [North Star & guardrails](./north-star-guardrails.md) — Keep direction, autonomy, and accountability in balance.
- [Policy → action: expenses](/pattern-expense-sla) — Show the expense SLA as a working example.
