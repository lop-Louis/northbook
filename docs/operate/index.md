Use this when you are changing **how the chapter runs**—state, stewards, signals, or blockers. Everything else waits.

<PilotPageList bucket="operate" />

## What is live in Operate

- **Chapter state** — the current snapshot and what to read before ops time.  
  → [Open chapter state](../changelog/state/web-frontend)
- **Steward roster** — owners for scope, signals, and exceptions plus backups.  
  → [Open steward roster](./stewards)
- **Signals roster** — the two health checks (roster freshness, clear next step).  
  → [Open signals roster](../learn/signals-roster)
- **Cloud-access stub** — log and handle serious access blocks.  
  → [Open cloud-access stub](../mitigate/exception-cloud-access)

## If you are changing the system itself

The **ops contract** explains guardrails, exceptions, and receipts for this pilot.  
Read it when you are working **on** Northbook, not just using it.  
→ [Open ops contract](./ops-contract)

If something breaks in Operate, open a PR or note and tag the steward roster contact; log blockers as exceptions.
