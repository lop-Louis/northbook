# State visibility map

Stop guessing whether work is stuck—let this map show the state, entry signal, and SLI guardrail for every stream. <a href="#weekly-15-minute-review-agenda" data-primary-action>Publish your state map</a> or <a href="./index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>. Pair this with a weekly 15-minute review so deviations surface fast.

| State | Entry signals (what must be true) | Exit signals (what closes the state) | SLI |
