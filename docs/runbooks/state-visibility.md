# State visibility map

<a href="#weekly-15-minute-review-agenda" data-primary-action>Use this map to publish states, entry/exit signals, and SLIs.</a>

<a href="./index" data-secondary-action>Browse the Runbooks index for hands-on checklists.</a>

Stop guessing whether work is stuck. Publish the shared state map so anyone can see where a stream sits and what proof moves it forward.
Pair this with a weekly 15-minute review so deviations surface fast.

| State | Entry signals (what must be true) | Exit signals (what closes the state) | SLI |
