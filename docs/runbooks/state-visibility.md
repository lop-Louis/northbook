# State visibility map

<a href="#weekly-15-minute-review-agenda" data-primary-action>Use this map to publish states, entry/exit signals, and SLIs.</a>

Stop guessing whether work is stuck. Publish the shared state map so anyone can see where a stream sits and what proof moves it forward.
Pair this with a weekly 15-minute review so deviations surface fast.

| State     | Entry signals (what must be true)                                      | Exit signals (what closes the state)                             | SLI                                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Idle      | No charter or owner assigned; request logged                           | Owner and one-line intent captured                               | "Idle streams drop below 10% of total work."                    |
| Framing   | Intent documented, constraints noted, collaborators invited            | Decision spine drafted with options + tradeoffs                  | "Framing wraps within 5 business days."                         |
| Ready     | Decision recorded, risks listed, backlog prioritized                   | RACI owners confirmed and kickoff scheduled                      | "Ready items start execution within 3 business days."           |
| In-flight | Team working against agreed backlog, daily updates flowing             | Exit metric trends positive, deliverable hits definition of done | "In-flight items deliver a meaningful increment every 2 weeks." |
| Review    | Work shipped to staging / audience; feedback requested                 | Primary reviewers sign off and SLO met                           | "Reviews close inside the approval SLA window."                 |
| Done      | Outcome tagged in Monthly Release; docs, runbooks, and metrics updated | Watch-window observation complete with no regressions            | "Done work stays on track for 30 days post-launch."             |
| Drift     | SLI slipped outside guardrail or owner missing                         | Corrective action logged, owner reassigned, or work archived     | "Drift gets addressed within one weekly review cycle."          |

## Weekly 15-minute review agenda

1. Pull up this state map and mark each stream's current state.
2. Highlight any stream stuck past its SLI (Framing > 5 days, etc.).
3. Assign owners to clear Drift items before the next review.
4. Note updates in the [Monthly Release Rhythm](../monthly-release.md) changelog.

Drop this agenda into your calendar invite so everyone knows the ritual.
