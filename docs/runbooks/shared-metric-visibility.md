# Shared metric visibility

When multiple teams chase one metric, this template keeps baseline → target → date honest. <a href="#template" data-primary-action>Fill in your metric table</a> or <a href="./index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>. Pair it with the [Monthly Release Rhythm](../monthly-release.md) so status stays current at each tag.

## Template

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Target date | Status band | Notes / owner |
