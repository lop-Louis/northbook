# Shared metric visibility

<a href="#template" data-primary-action>Use this template to track the shared metric's baseline, target, and review date.</a>

<a href="./index" data-secondary-action>Browse the Runbooks index for hands-on checklists.</a>

Use this template when multiple teams need a single metric to guide a transition.
Pair it with the [Monthly Release Rhythm](../monthly-release.md) so status stays current at each tag.

## Template

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Target date | Status band | Notes / owner |
