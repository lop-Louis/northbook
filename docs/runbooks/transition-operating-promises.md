# Transition operating promises

<a href="#approvals-template" data-primary-action>Use these templates to codify approvals, escalations, and cadence promises.</a>

<a href="./index" data-secondary-action>Browse the Runbooks index for hands-on checklists.</a>

Pair these prompts with the [Handover RACI template](./handover-raci-template.md) so every role knows the service level they own during a transition.
Stick to the `condition -> action -> owner -> time box` structure for Band A clarity.

## Approvals template

| Condition | Action | Primary owner | Time box / SLA | Backup |
