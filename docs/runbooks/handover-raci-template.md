# Handover RACI template

<a href="#how-to-use-it" data-primary-action>Use this template and example to publish a handover RACI.</a>

<a href="./index" data-secondary-action>Browse the Runbooks index for hands-on checklists.</a>

Use this page when you need to broadcast handover roles without exposing internal specifics.
The structure below stays inside the [Anti-drift Content Governance](../governance.md) guardrails and keeps RACI labels uncluttered.

## How to use it

1. Duplicate the template table into your handover document.
2. Replace the placeholder rows with the concrete activities in scope.
3. Stick to role names or generic titles (for example, "On-call engineer") rather than personal identifiers.
4. Link to the supporting [Runbooks index](./index.md) if you need step-by-step execution support.
5. Pair each owner with the [transition operating promises](./transition-operating-promises.md) so SLA and backup coverage stays visible.

## Template

> Tip: keep one row per decision or activity so the RACI stays readable.

| Activity / Decision | Responsible (R) | Accountable (A) | Consulted (C) | Informed (I) | Notes |
