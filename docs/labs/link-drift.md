## Goal

Ship a page without broken links in under 10 minutes.

## Steps

1. Build the docs

   ```bash
   pnpm docs:build
   ```

   Expect "Build complete."

2) Check links

   ```bash
   node scripts/check-links.mjs
   ```

   Expect "0 broken links."

## Pass/Fail

Pass if both commands exit 0 within 10 minutes. Otherwise fail, shrink scope, retry.
