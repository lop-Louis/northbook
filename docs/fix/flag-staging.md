Confirm staging feature flags in minutes before looping in the platform team. [Run the flag checks](#quick-path) or [Escalate to Support IT](/support-it/contacting-it).

> **Works here:** staging · Feature flag SDK · Regions: MY, DK  
> **Owner:** Platform Engineering (`/support-it/contacting-it`)

## Quick path

1. **Env check**: App shows **Staging** build and commit hash matches latest.

2. **SDK key**: Staging key is configured (not Production).
3. **Flag exists**: The exact flag key is present and **on** for staging environment.
4. **User context**: The attributes used in targeting (email, role, cohort) are present in the SDK init.
5. **Force refresh**: Clear cache and call the SDK’s `flush/identify/variation` test.

### Code snippet (evaluate a flag)

```ts
const on = client.variation('my-flag-key', { key: userId, role }, false)
console.log('flag my-flag-key =', on)
```

### Escalation package

```
Flag key: <key>
SDK: <name + version>
Context: { userId: "...", role: "...", cohort: "..." }
Staging build hash: <abc123>
Expected vs observed: <1 line>
Console/network screenshots attached
```
