Resolve the highest-volume interrupts with a single click. [Pick the quick-check flow](#flows) or [Escalate straight to Support IT](/support-it/contacting-it).

Each page sticks to the 10-minute path and ends with a ready-to-paste escalation packet.

## Flows

- [Teams notifications](./teams-notifications.md) — Restore toast/badge alerts across devices before calling IT.
- [Repo or pipeline access](./access-repo-pipeline.md) — Confirm membership, branch rules, and run permissions prior to filing a ticket.
- [Design System component decision](./ds-component-decision.md) — Decide whether to use, extend, compose, or fork without relitigating.
- [Flag not behaving on Staging](./flag-staging.md) — Validate env, SDK keys, and targeting before pinging Platform.
- [VWO/Bloomreach sanity](./vwo-bloomreach-sanity.md) — Detect duplicate injections, CSP blocks, or wrong keys fast.
