Unblock repo or pipeline access in five minutes, then escalate with a clean request. [Follow the quick checks](#quick-path) or [Escalate to Support IT](/support-it/contacting-it).

## Quick path

1. **Org membership**: Confirm you’re in the correct org/tenant. If SSO, re-authenticate.

2. **Team role**: Ask your team lead to add you to the repo group (least privilege).
3. **Repo visibility**: Private vs internal; confirm the repo actually exists under the org.
4. **Branch protection**: If you can see but cannot push, check protection rules and required reviews.
5. **Pipeline run permission** (ADO/GitHub Actions): ensure you’re in the “Run pipelines” role or Actions is allowed for forks.

### CLI snippet to verify your permission (GitHub)

```bash
gh repo view <org>/<repo> --json name,viewerPermission
```

If `viewerPermission` is `"none"` or `"read"` and you need write, proceed to escalate.

## Escalation package

```
Repo/pipeline: <org>/<repo> or <ado project/pipeline>
Needed role: read|triage|write|maintain|admin
Reason (1 line): <ticket/user story or incident>
Owner/approver: <team lead or repo owner>
Start/End date: <if temporary>
```
