Keep Teams notifications reliable with a 10-minute check path before involving IT. <a href="#quick-path-3-7-checks" data-primary-action>Run the quick checks</a> or <a href="/support-it/contacting-it" data-secondary-action>Escalate to Support IT</a>.

> **Works here:** prod · Microsoft Teams desktop/web · Regions: MY, DK  
> **Owner:** Support IT liaison (`/support-it/contacting-it`)

## Quick path (3–7 checks)

1. **Teams settings**: Profile → Settings → **Notifications**. Ensure Global = All, affected channel is **Followed**.

2. **Do Not Disturb / Focus**: Windows Focus Assist OFF; macOS Do Not Disturb OFF during work hours.
3. **OS notifications**: System → Notifications → Teams = Allowed (banner + badge).

4. **Membership**: Confirm you’re still a member of the team and the channel is **Follow** not **Mute**.
5. **Web vs desktop**: Try web at <https://teams.microsoft.com>. If web works but desktop doesn’t, sign out and back in.
6. **Cache reset**: Sign out, fully quit Teams, reboot.

> **Done** when a step restores toasts or badges.

## When to escalate

Escalate if:

- Fails on **multiple devices** or both web and desktop.
- Settings look correct but no toast after 30 minutes on a known active channel.
- You see license prompts or permission errors.

### Escalation package (paste in ticket)

```

## Why we do it this way

Upstream policy and device settings dominate behavior; we keep only a 10-minute path then hand off to IT as source of truth.

**Handoff** → [/support-it/contacting-it](/support-it/contacting-it)
