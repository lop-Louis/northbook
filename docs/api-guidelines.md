# API Guidelines (Stub)

Neutral, public-safe defaults keep every HTTP+JSON API predictable while the full guide is in flight. [Apply the API defaults](#core-principles) or [Browse the runbooks index](./operate/runbooks-index).

## Core Principles

1. Consistency over cleverness
2. Minimal surface area; evolve additively
3. Predictable pagination, errors, and versioning
4. Clear separation of concerns (resource vs operation)

## Resource Modeling

- Use plural nouns: `/users`, `/invoices`
- Nest only to express containment: `/users/{id}/sessions`
- Avoid deep nesting (>2 levels) — prefer top-level plus filters

## HTTP Methods

| Method | Use |
