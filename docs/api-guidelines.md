# API Guidelines (Stub)

Neutral, public-safe defaults keep every HTTP+JSON API predictable while the full guide is in flight. <a href="#core-principles" data-primary-action>Apply the API defaults</a> or <a href="./runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>.

## Core Principles

1. Consistency over cleverness
2. Minimal surface area; evolve additively
3. Predictable pagination, errors, and versioning
4. Clear separation of concerns (resource vs operation)

## Resource Modeling

- Use plural nouns: `/users`, `/invoices`
- Nest only to express containment: `/users/{id}/sessions`
- Avoid deep nesting (>2 levels) — prefer top-level plus filters

## HTTP Methods
