# Sanitization Guidance

Northbook only ships guidance that anyone can quote safely. [Run the sanitization checklist](#what-sanitization-protects) or [Browse the runbooks index](./runbooks/index). Use these guardrails to keep every page linkable while chore-like checklists stay in `/runbooks`.

## What Sanitization Protects

- **People** — strip personal data, names, emails, or avatars that could identify someone.
- **Systems** — remove URLs, ticket IDs, and architecture breadcrumbs tied to internal tools.
- **Signals** — convert precise numbers or dates into ranges and relative time so nothing leaks velocity or runway.
- **Brand** — recreate screenshots with dummy data instead of redacting; avoid dragging internal UI chrome into public view.

If a fact is safe enough for a press release, it is safe enough for Northbook.

## Rewrite Instead of Redact
