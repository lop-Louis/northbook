# Stop Rules Library

Stop rules protect teams from marching forward when risk outpaces confidence. <a href="#when-to-write-a-stop-rule" data-primary-action>Capture your stop conditions</a> or <a href="../runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>. Define them before work starts so everyone knows when to pause, escalate, or roll back.

## When to write a stop rule

- The plan hinges on a guardrail metric staying green.
- Work depends on external approvals or time-limited windows.
- A previous incident showed that drift goes unnoticed until it is too late.

## Crafting effective rules

1. **Name the condition.** Describe the observable signal—not a vibe.
2. **State the action.** Pause, rollback, escalate, or regroup. Keep it unambiguous.
3. **Assign the owner.** One role pulls the brake and communicates next steps.
4. **Set the time box.** Clarify how long the pause lasts or when to reassess.
5. **Link to the metric.** Reference the dashboard or data source that triggers the rule.
