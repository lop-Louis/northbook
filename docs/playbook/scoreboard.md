# Common Goal Scoreboard

Scoreboards make a shared outcome visible so every stream knows if the work is moving the needle. Use them when multiple teams touch the same metric and you need one place to track momentum.

## Anatomy of a scoreboard

| Piece              | Guidance                                                       | Example                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal statement     | Start with an action verb and the metric you’re moving.        | “Increase activated workspaces on self-serve plans.”    |
| Baseline           | Current value, updated with the last verified check-in.        | “Baseline: 430 (validated last month).”                 |
| Target             | The next meaningful threshold, not a random stretch.           | “Target: 520 sustained for four weeks.”                 |
| Review cadence     | How often you look at the metric together.                     | “Review: every Monday stand-up; roll-up monthly.”       |
| Owner + partners   | Role responsible for updates and the teams contributing.       | “Owner: Growth PM · Partners: Marketing, Activation.”   |
| Leading indicators | Supporting signals that show early progress or issues.         | “Leading: onboarding completion rate, support tickets.” |
| Risks              | Known constraints or upcoming events that may affect the goal. | “Risk: billing migration in Q1 may depress upgrades.”   |

## How to build one

1. **Pick the outcome metric.** Tie it to value, not output. If it’s vanity, choose again.
2. **Document the baseline with evidence.** Link to the query or dashboard so anyone can verify.
3. **Set the target with intent.** Choose a number that matters to customers or the business.
4. **Name the review cadence.** Put it on the calendar; stale scoreboards erode trust.
5. **Assign an owner.** One role maintains the board and pulls partners when the metric slips.
6. **Track notes.** Add context when you adjust scope or learn from experiments.

## Example layout

```markdown
## Goal: Increase activated workspaces on self-serve plans

- **Baseline:** 430 active workspaces (latest pull: last month)
- **Target:** 520 for four consecutive weeks
- **Review:** Weekly in Growth stand-up; recap in monthly release note
- **Owner:** Growth PM · **Partners:** Marketing, Activation, Support
- **Leading indicators:** Onboarding completion %, setup checklist drop-off
- **Risks:** Payment flow migration in Q1 could delay upgrades
```

Keep the scoreboard in the Answer Ledger or team workspace, and reference it in release notes so everyone sees the through-line from guidance to observable results.
