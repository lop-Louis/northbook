# RACI by Seams

Mapping RACI by seam keeps ownership stable even when teams reorganize. [Use the seam-first template](#why-seams-not-teams) or [Browse the runbooks index](../runbooks/index). Each seam represents a boundary where ownership often fuzzes—APIs ↔ clients, platform ↔ feature, product ↔ ops.

## Why seams, not teams

- Teams reorganize; seams persist where work hands off.
- Seams keep focus on outcomes (“Data quality”) instead of reporting lines.
- Ownership debates shrink when the table names the seam first.

## Drafting the table

1. **List the seams.** Capture the interfaces where hand-offs hurt the most.
2. **Assign roles, not people.** Roles survive reorgs; handles change.
3. **Keep it lean.** One R, one A. Add C/I only if they act on the seam.
4. **Validate with the seam owners.** Walk the table together and confirm nothing overlaps.
5. **Link to supporting docs.** Decisions go to the <u>[Decision Spine](../decision-spine.md)</u>; policies go to the <u>[Answer Ledger](../answer-ledger.md)</u>.
