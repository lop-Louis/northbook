# RACI by Seams

<a href="#why-seams-not-teams" data-primary-action>Use the seam-first template to map who owns each boundary.</a>

<a href="../runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the Runbooks index for hands-on checklists.</a>

Map the work around seams instead of teams so responsibility stays clear when streams shift. Each seam represents a boundary where ownership often fuzzes—APIs ↔ clients, platform ↔ feature, product ↔ ops.

## Why seams, not teams

- Teams reorganize; seams persist where work hands off.
- Seams keep focus on outcomes (“Data quality”) instead of reporting lines.
- Ownership debates shrink when the table names the seam first.

## Drafting the table

1. **List the seams.** Capture the interfaces where hand-offs hurt the most.
2. **Assign roles, not people.** Roles survive reorgs; handles change.
3. **Keep it lean.** One R, one A. Add C/I only if they act on the seam.
4. **Validate with the seam owners.** Walk the table together and confirm nothing overlaps.
5. **Link to supporting docs.** Decisions go to the <u>[Decision Spine](../decision-spine.md)</u>; policies go to the <u>[Answer Ledger](../answer-ledger.md)</u>.
