# Guides ≠ Rules

Guides suggest a preferred path. Rules mandate a specific behavior. Mixing them creates frustration and erodes trust. Use this page when you document a practice so readers immediately know how much freedom they have.

## Spot the difference

| Signal         | Guide                                                    | Rule                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Language       | “Prefer”, “Consider”, “When in doubt”                    | “Must”, “Required”, “Do not”                |
| Enforcement    | Social pressure, reviews, coaching                       | Automated checks, policy owners, compliance |
| Flexibility    | Opt-out with rationale                                   | Exceptions logged and approved              |
| Source         | Team-level expertise                                     | Corporate, legal, regulatory mandates       |
| Change process | Light discussion, decision recorded in the Answer Ledger | Formal change control, versioned policies   |

## How to label your content

1. **Decide the intent.** If breaking the guidance should block a launch, it’s not guidance—call it a rule.
2. **Use precise language.** Avoid hedging when you mean “must,” and avoid “must” when you mean “preferred.”
3. **Link to the authority.** For rules, cite the policy or legal requirement. For guides, link to the Decision Spine that shaped the recommendation.
4. **Provide escape hatches.** If it’s guidance, explain how to diverge responsibly.

## Escalation posture

- Local guidance yields to corporate policy. When the two conflict, follow the rule and flag the inconsistency.
- If a guide keeps causing exceptions, revisit the Decision Spine: either promote it to a rule or loosen it.
- When a rule creates friction with customer outcomes, gather evidence and open a review with the policy owner.

Stay honest about which is which—clarity keeps teams moving without needing a checklist.
