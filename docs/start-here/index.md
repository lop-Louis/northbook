<a href="#essentials" data-primary-action>Use these essentials to align voice, UI, and flow before you ship.</a>

Use this hub when you need the current voice, UI, and operational rules before shipping anything public.

- [UI Baseline](./ui) — Shared layout, typography, and state specs for consistent visual design.
- [SLI States](./sli-states) — How work moves across framing, build, and verification.
