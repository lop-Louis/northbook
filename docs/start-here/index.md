  Entry point for the pilot when you are not sure which chapter ops page to open first.
---

For now, Northbook is a small pilot focused on the **frontend chapter**.

It is here to help you answer two questions:

1. Where does my question or change belong?
2. Who should I talk to or what should I read next?

There is no full playbook behind this page yet on purpose.  
We only expose the pieces that are already in use.

<PageCTA />

> **Expected Takeaway:** you leave knowing whether you should look at the **chapter state** or at **who owns what** next.

## Quick links for the web frontend pilot

<PilotPageList :max-items="8" />

## If you want to see where the chapter stands

Open the **chapter state** page:

- see what the current pilot covers
- see which ops pages are actively in play
- use it as a quick briefing before a chapter ops session

> [Open chapter state](../changelog/state/web-frontend)

## If you want to know who owns what

Open the **steward roster**:

- see who looks after scope, signals, and exceptions
- see who is backup and how fast they’re expected to respond

> [Open steward roster](../operate/stewards)

## If this still feels unclear

If you reached this page and still feel lost, treat that as useful feedback.

Raise it in the next chapter ops session or with whoever shared Northbook with you so we can adjust this entrance.
