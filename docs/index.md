For now, Northbook is a **small pilot** for the web frontend chapter.

It does three things:

1. shows where the chapter stands
2. shows who owns which part of ops
3. gives a simple path when cloud access blocks work

There is no full playbook here yet on purpose. What you see is what we are actually using.

## Start here

Choose what matches your situation today.

### I want to see where the chapter stands

Go to the **chapter state** page:

- see the latest snapshot for this pilot
- see which ops pages are currently in play

> [Open chapter state](./changelog/state/web-frontend)

### I want to know who owns what in ops

Open the **steward roster**:

- see who is on point for scope, signals, and exceptions
- see who is backup and how fast they are expected to respond

> [Open steward roster](./operate/stewards)

### I want to see the two health checks

Open the **signals roster**:

- roster freshness: do we have a current picture of each person?
- direction after sessions: do people leave knowing their next step?

You do not have to touch metrics directly. Just use it to sense if we are drifting.

> [Open signals roster](./learn/signals-roster)

### I am blocked by cloud access

Use the **cloud-access stub**:

- log the blocker with an owner and an expiry
- use the agreed temporary path so work can keep moving safely

> [Open cloud-access stub](./mitigate/exception-cloud-access)

## If you help maintain this pilot

If you are updating these pages or wiring automation around them, there is a separate ops contract that explains:

- the few guardrails we keep
- how releases and state are generated
- how traceability works without cluttering these pages

That contract is written for operators, not first-time visitors. Use it when you are working on the system, not when you just need an answer.

## If this home page did not help

If you could not find a useful page or a clear next step from here, tell us.

We will treat it as a signal that the entrance is wrong, not that you are.

> If you help maintain Northbook and need history or traceability, use the [Releases view](./changelog/releases/). It is written for operators and auditors, not for first-time visitors.
