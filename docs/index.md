Find the answer. Act within 60 seconds. [Use the starting links](./start-here/) or [Read the North Star & Guardrails](./playbook/north-star-guardrails).

**Protect the North Star.** Every page has an owner, band, exit metric, and links to State and Receipts. Default deny outside the guardrails. Exceptions need owner, reason, expiry, rollback, and stop rule—but they're allowed.

## Governance & Safety

### Invariants enforced:

1. **Default deny outside the guardrails** — If a change is not covered, it is out of scope.
2. **Public Band-A content only** — No sensitive or internal-only information.
3. **Runnable in 10 minutes** — Hard gate for ops annex labs.
4. **Exceptions expire automatically** — No entry, no work.
5. **One owner and date on every change** — Clear accountability.
6. **Sanitize for public use before publish** — Privacy and safety first.

Automation enforces: frontmatter completeness, Band-A sanitization, secret scan, build integrity. See [North Star & Guardrails](./playbook/north-star-guardrails) for the full contract.

## Philosophy

1. **Direction first. Methods are free.** The North Star is fixed; the path to reach it is flexible.
2. **Transparency builds trust.** Public state, receipts, and traceability prevent hidden work.
3. **Defaults, not diktats.** Good defaults make the right behavior easy. Exceptions need owner, reason, expiry, rollback, and stop rule—but they're allowed.
4. **Small bets, steady gains.** Single bet per cycle. Pilot first for wide changes. Stop if receipts are flat or negative beyond the stop rule.
5. **Evidence over opinion.** Receipts › analytics › heuristic review › opinion. Clarity over chrome.
6. **Runnable in 10 minutes.** Hard gate for ops annex labs. Keeps experiments lightweight and feedback fast.

## Opening a PR

Before submitting:

- `pnpm run docs:guard` — Enforces guardrails and Band-A sanitization
- `pnpm run docs:build` — Verifies build integrity
- Ensure no internal names, hard dates, or ticket IDs
- One owner and date on every change
- Keep scope aligned with declared `change_type`

**Stop rule:** If CI adds more than 15 minutes per day across two weeks, remove the last added check and reassess ROI.

## Receipts & State

### Tracked per 14-day cycle:

- **Adoption** — Pages touched and time to answer
- **Quality** — Lab pass rate and broken link count
- **Credibility** — State page freshness and exceptions resolved on time

Monthly release captures meaningful changes in [releases](./release.md). State page updated within 30 days.
