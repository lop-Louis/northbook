## Why this exists

**Curated quick-paths with escalation packets and governance guardrails**, not another wiki. Every runbook includes a clear escalation path when self-service hits a wall. See [Fix-it-fast flows](./runbooks/index) for common interrupts or [Governance](./governance) for content lifecycle rules.

## North-star KPIs

Track what sponsors care about:

- **Time-to-answer** for common interrupts
- **% escalations** with complete packet
- **Stale pages** at tag time
