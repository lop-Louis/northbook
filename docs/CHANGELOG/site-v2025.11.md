# site-v2025.11 · Patch hygiene

This changelog captures the mid-November hygiene release so you can skim what shipped. [Scan the changes](#added) or [Browse the runbooks index](../runbooks/index).

**Tag date:** Mid-November release window

## Added

- **Decision Tripwires** page: three condition → action prompts for missing owner/date, SLA breaches, and metric regression.
- **Runbooks:** Handover RACI template, Transition operating promises, Shared metric visibility, State visibility map, and Accessibility Audit runbook now live with sanitized examples.
- **CTA policy:** Anti-drift governance now requires inline primary + secondary CTA pairs per page; frontmatter `primary_action` removed in favor of body-level actions and Feedback.vue fallbacks.
- **Tooling:** `scripts/frontmatter-lint.mjs` (with nav support), and `scripts/sync-navigation.mjs` shipped to keep frontmatter `nav` metadata, generated nav, and `.vitepress/config.ts` aligned.
- **Governance traceability:** Added dedicated `contracts/` and `decisions/` directories. Logged the [Contracts directory decision](../decisions/contracts-directory.md) and published the [Northbook Operations Contract v1.0](../contracts/northbook-operations-contract-v1.md) with links back to this release and the State/Receipts surfaces.
- **Signals & analytics:** Logged the [Cloudflare analytics decision](../decisions/cloudflare-analytics.md), shipped [`scripts/cloudflare-analytics.mjs`](../../scripts/cloudflare-analytics.mjs), and added the [Cloudflare analytics](../runbooks/cloudflare-analytics.md) + [Signal Registry](../runbooks/signal-registry.md) runbooks so adoption/quality/credibility receipts come from sanitized exports.
- **CTA guardrail:** Logged the draft [CTA guardrail alignment decision](../decisions/cta-guardrail-alignment.md) that pauses the markdown-only CTA scan in favor of the above-the-fold post-build check until new metadata automation lands.
- **Release folders:** Logged the [release-centric ops folders decision](../decisions/release-folders.md), created `ops/releases/2025-11/index.md`, and added a CI check plus State/Receipts links so each release bundles its artefacts predictably.
- **State automation:** Logged [Automate state and release pages](../decisions/automation-state-pages.md), added `scripts/generate-state.mjs`, and wired `pnpm run state:check` into CI so State + release indices regenerate from `ops/releases/YYYY-MM/manifest.json`.

## Updated

- Governance policy references the internal `GOVERNANCE.md` for automation/RACI, documents nav metadata as the source of truth, and clarifies guard/drift/Lighthouse/nav routing.
- All guidance pages now open with a single sentence plus inline CTA pair, refreshed copy, and secondary actions pointing to runbooks or the feedback helper.
- README aligns with governance (nav metadata, helpful scripts), and runbook pages now include identical CTA contracts.
- Top-level docs (Band A, FAQ, Sanitization, Start Here, Runbooks index, etc.) all got tone-aligned intros plus CTA pairs, making the UX consistent.
- Homepage hero/feature trio now reflects the end-to-end promise (Orientation → Checks → Receipts) with CTAs to Wayfinding, Quick-Run, and the Fast support hub.
- Start, Guides, Runbooks, and Fast support groups gained “Related references” tables so every doc points to the next action (e.g., Quick-Run → Link Integrity, Runbooks ↔ Transition promises, Playbook pages ↔ Runbooks).
- Navigation labels regrouped into Start, Guides, Runbooks, Contributor Kit, Fast support with friendlier names (e.g., “Wayfinding shortcuts,” “Link Integrity,” “Interrupt flows”) and the generated nav now mirrors the governance taxonomy.
- Runbooks now include fully populated checklists/tables (timer-based 20-minute handover, Accessibility audit evidence template, Community pack agenda, Transition promises escalation ladder, Shared/State visibility samples) so the flows are copy-paste ready.

## Fixed

- Removed duplicate CTA callouts, ensured `nav` metadata is present across all frontmatter, and added a nav guard so `.vitepress/navigation.generated.ts` matches the docs.
- Styled global link underline in the VitePress theme so anchors stay accessible without wrapping everything in `<u>`.
- Changelog/Releases pages now use the inline CTA/summary pattern.
- Patched internal links flagged by guard (Wayfinding shortcuts reference, runbooks links inside Monthly cadence) so all Start/Guides/Fast support cross-links resolve.

### Governance receipts

- Zero 404s at build.
- At least one page emitted `doc_helped` events.
