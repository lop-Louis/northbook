# site-v2025.11 · Patch hygiene

This changelog captures the mid-November hygiene release so you can skim what shipped. <a href="#added" data-primary-action>Scan the changes</a> or <a href="../runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>.

**Tag date:** Mid-November release window

## Added

- **Decision Tripwires** page: three condition → action prompts for missing owner/date, SLA breaches, and metric regression.
- **Runbooks:** Handover RACI template, Transition operating promises, Shared metric visibility, and State visibility map now live with sanitized examples.
- **UX + UI Standard:** Playbook entry codifying layout width, typography scale, link styling, color rules, a11y guardrails, allowed components, and media requirements.
- **Tooling:** `scripts/ux-scan.mjs` enforces primary-action tone plus heading rhythm; CTA verifier now scans every published route.

## Updated

- Governance policy now references the internal `GOVERNANCE.md` for automation/RACI, removing redundant Band A copy.
- Anti-drift governance now requires a primary + secondary CTA pair in the body (frontmatter `primary_action` removed) and documents the difference from project governance.
- Every doc with `primary_action` exposes it above the fold via a `data-primary-action` anchor; legacy runbooks cleaned up to match.
- Runbooks index, Decision Spine, Handshake Contracts, RACI by Seams, Stop Rules, Scoreboard, and other Playbook pages now link to the new templates and use underlined cross-links per the UX standard.
- Homepage CTA clarified (“Use these starting links…”), and multiple guidance pages (Band A, FAQ, Sanitization, Start Here, etc.) refreshed to the new tone.

## Fixed

- Removed duplicate CTA callouts and ensured CTA placement ignores the home layout to prevent false positives.
- Styled global link underline in the VitePress theme so anchors stay accessible without wrapping everything in `<u>`.
- Changelog page itself now carries a `data-primary-action` and the release flow documents the shared metric snapshot link.

### Governance receipts

- Zero 404s at build.
- At least one page emitted `doc_helped` events.
