  Where we park the ugly stuff for this pilot: blocks, exceptions, and how we decide what to do
  about them.

Use this when work is **blocked** and you need an open, safe path forward.

<PilotPageList bucket="mitigate" />

## What is live in Mitigate

- **Cloud-access stub** — log the blocker, owner, expiry, and safe fallback.  
  → [Open cloud-access stub](./exception-cloud-access)
- **Who to ask** — use the steward roster if you are unsure whether it belongs here.  
  → [Open steward roster](../operate/stewards)

If it is not about a real blocker, it stays out of Mitigate for now.

If a blocker needs escalation, log it in the stub and flag the steward roster contact.
