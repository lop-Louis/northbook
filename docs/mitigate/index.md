  Where we park the ugly stuff for this pilot: blocks, exceptions, and how we decide what to do
  about them.
---

Use this page when something is **blocking work** and you want to handle it in the open, not in private chats.

Exit metric: you leave knowing whether your blocker belongs in the **cloud-access stub** or somewhere else, and what to do next.  
Most pilot-era blocks go here:

## What “Mitigate” means in this pilot

This lane is about handling trouble:

- access gaps
- process issues that stall work
- things that keep repeating but never quite get fixed

In the pilot, we start with one concrete case: **cloud-platform access** problems for people doing DevOps and delivery work.

## Cloud-access blocks

Use the **cloud-access exception stub** when:

- you cannot do needed work because of missing access, tooling, or unclear responsibility
- it affects more than just one trivial task
- you need a safe temporary path while the fix is in progress

On that page you can:

- log the blocker with an owner and an expiry
- agree on a temporary route so work can continue safely
- see what must be true before we close the exception

> [Open cloud-access stub](./exception-cloud-access)

## Who to talk to

If you are unsure whether to log something as an exception, check the **steward roster**:

- find the exception steward
- ask whether this belongs in Mitigate or somewhere else

> [Open steward roster](../operate/stewards)

## Growing this lane

As we learn which kinds of blocks recur often, this lane may grow to include more specific guides or stubs.

For the pilot, we keep it at one clear pattern and do that well first.
