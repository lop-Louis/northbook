# Decision tripwires

<a href="#top" data-primary-action>Use these tripwires to define when a decision needs intervention.</a>

Tripwires convert slow drift into clear prompts to act. Pair them with the [Decision Spine](./decision-spine.md) so each decision has a safety net.

Each example follows the `condition -> action -> owner -> time box` format so you can drop it straight into a decision follow-up checklist.

| Condition                                                       | Action                                                                       | Owner                | Time box                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Decision record missing owner or review date                    | Pause publication, assign owner role, set next review in the Decision Spine  | Decision facilitator | Within 24 hours of spotting the gap        |
| Approval workflow exceeds 2 business days past SLA              | Trigger escalated review in shared channel and log blocker in decision notes | Accountable decider  | Raise within next business day             |
| Lead metric trends outside agreed band for 2 consecutive checks | Run fast root-cause huddle and prepare go/no-go recommendation               | Stream owner         | Convene within 48 hours of the second miss |

Document the trigger alongside the Decision Spine review plan so owners know exactly when to jump back in.
