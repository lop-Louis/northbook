# Decision tripwires

Tripwires convert slow drift into clear prompts to act. <a href="#top" data-primary-action>Define your triggers</a> or <a href="./runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>. Pair them with the [Decision Spine](./decision-spine.md) so each decision has a safety net.

Each example follows the `condition -> action -> owner -> time box` format so you can drop it straight into a decision follow-up checklist.

| Condition | Action | Owner | Time box |
