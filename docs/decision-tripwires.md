# Decision tripwires

Tripwires convert slow drift into clear prompts to act. [Define your triggers](#decision-tripwires) or [Browse the runbooks index](./operate/runbooks-index). Pair them with the [Decision Spine](./decision-spine.md) so each decision has a safety net.

Each example follows the `condition -> action -> owner -> time box` format so you can drop it straight into a decision follow-up checklist.

| Condition | Action | Owner | Time box |
