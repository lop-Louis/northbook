# Facilitation Techniques

Small, plug-and-play patterns keep collaborative sessions focused and inclusive. <a href="#silent-brainstorming" data-primary-action>Pick a facilitation pattern</a> or <a href="./runbooks/index" data-secondary-action>Browse the runbooks index</a>.

- **Why**: Prevents drift, balances voices, and converts meetings into clear outcomes instead of vague discussion.
- **When**: Kickoffs, retros, prioritization, brainstorming, or anytime alignment feels slow or uneven.

## Silent brainstorming

Generates broad idea diversity before any group influence sets in.

**When:** Generating ideas without groupthink

1. State the problem clearly
2. Everyone writes ideas for 5 minutes (no talking)
3. Share round-robin, one idea per person
4. Cluster similar ideas
5. Vote or prioritize

**Why it works:** Introverts contribute equally, prevents loudest voice bias

## 1-2-4-All

Progressively scales individual thought into shared, converged options.

**When:** Building consensus on options

1. **1 min solo:** Think about the question individually
2. **2 mins pairs:** Share with one person, refine ideas
3. **4 mins groups:** Pairs join another pair, align
4. **All:** Groups report out to everyone

**Why it works:** Everyone has input, energy stays high

## Dot voting

Quick visual prioritization that highlights collective energy hotspots.

**When:** Prioritizing from many options

1. List all options on a board/doc
2. Give each person 3-5 "dots" (votes)
3. Vote in silence (can split dots or stack on favorites)
4. Count votes, discuss top 3

**Why it works:** Fast, visual, democratizes choice

## Fist to five

Fast agreement scan surfacing objections early while showing support depth.

**When:** Checking agreement level

Everyone shows fingers:

- 0 (fist): Block, cannot support
- 1-2: Concerns, want discussion
- 3: Neutral, will go with group
- 4: Support with minor reservations
- 5: Strongly support

**Why it works:** Shows nuance, surfaces objections early

## Parking lot

Captures tangents safely so momentum stays on the core objective.

**When:** Managing tangents in meetings

1. Keep a visible list (doc section, whiteboard)
2. When off-topic comes up: "Let's park that"
3. Add to list with name of person who raised it
4. Review at end or in follow-up

**Why it works:** Respects contributor, keeps meeting on track

## Time boxing

Enforces crisp decision cadence and prevents fatigue-driven poor choices.

**When:** Preventing endless discussions

- Set visible timer for each agenda item
- Call "last 2 minutes" warning
- At time: either decide or explicitly table it
- Default decision if no consensus: smallest reversible step

**Why it works:** Forces crisp thinking, prevents fatigue

## Tips

- 🎯 State the decision criteria upfront
- 🔇 Use silence: "Take 30 seconds to think before speaking"
- 🔄 Rotate facilitator role to build skills
- 📝 Document decisions immediately in the meeting
