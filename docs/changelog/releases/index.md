This page is for people who need to see **what changed when**, not for day-to-day work.

If you just need a current picture, use the [chapter state · web frontend pilot](../../changelog/state/web-frontend) instead.

## Releases in this pilot

For now, we only track the pilot under one release tag:

- `site-v2025.11` · web frontend chapter ops pilot  
  → [Open release bundle](../../changelog/releases/site-v2025.11)

As the pilot grows, new tags will show up here. No tag, no history.
