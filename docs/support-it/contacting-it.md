Escalate stubborn IT issues with a clean packet so the liaison can act fast. [Prep the escalation packet](#prep-the-packet) or [Pick a contact channel](#contact-options).

> **Works here:** staging + prod · Teams + ServiceNow · Regions: MY, DK  
> **Owner:** Support IT liaison (<support-it@northbook.guide>)

## Prep the packet

1. **Summarize the impact** in one sentence (team, workflow, urgency).
2. **Attach evidence**: screenshots, logs, and the steps from the quick path you already ran.
3. **State what you need**: toggle access, unblock device, confirm policy, etc.
4. **List approvers** with contact handles so IT can reach them on the first pass.

## Contact options

- **Service desk ticket (preferred):** ServiceNow → _IT / Support_ → Assignment group `Support IT Liaison`. Paste the packet, add severity (P1–P4), and link to the originating runbook.
- **Backup chat:** Post the packet in `#support-it` (Teams) and @mention `@Support IT Liaison` so they can triage while you file the ticket.
- **Emergency only:** Call the on-call number from ServiceNow if the blocker is regulatory or customer-facing and note the incident ID afterward.

## SLA + escalation

| Priority | Trigger                    | First response   | Resolution target |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| P1       | Regulatory/customer impact | 15 minutes       | 4 hours           |
| P2       | Multiple users blocked     | 1 hour           | 1 business day    |
| P3       | Single user interruption   | 4 business hours | 2 business days   |
| P4       | Informational              | 1 business day   | 5 business days   |

Missed SLA? Reply to the ticket, @mention the liaison again, then escalate via the `/escalations` contact listed in [/governance](/governance).

**Handoff** → Quick paths usually live under [/runbooks](../runbooks/index.md); link that context when you escalate.
