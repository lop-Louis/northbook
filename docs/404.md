# 404 · Page not found

The page you tried to open doesn’t exist anymore, or the link was wrong.

Exit metric: you leave this page with one working link to follow next.

## Quick ways back in

Choose the option that sounds closest to what you needed.

### I just want a safe starting point

- [Go to the homepage](/)
- [Start here · Northbook pilot](/start-here/)

### I was looking for chapter ops info

- [See the chapter state (pilot)](/operate/state/web-frontend)
- [See who owns what · Steward roster](/operate/stewards)

### I was looking for “how we’re doing”

- [Open the signals roster](/learn/signals-roster)

### I’m blocked by access or process

- [Open the cloud-access stub](/mitigate/exception-cloud-access)

## If you still can’t find it

If none of these links help, you can:

- Use the search bar (press `/` to focus), or
- Open an issue with the broken URL so we can wire it back up:
  - [Report the missing page](https://github.com/lop-louis/northbook/issues/new?labels=question&title=%5B404%5D%20Missing%20Page)

We treat 404s as a sign our maps are off, not that you clicked the wrong thing.
