Release receipts now live inside the automated [State ledger](../state/index.md) and the per-release bundles under `ops/releases/`.

- Open `docs/state/index.md` to see the latest site-vYYYY.MM entry with adoption/quality/credibility highlights.
- Each entry is generated from `ops/releases/YYYY-MM/manifest.json`; update the manifest and run `pnpm run state:build` whenever you tag a release.
- For raw metrics (analytics snapshot, labs report, exceptions), refer to the files referenced in the manifest (e.g., `reports/cloudflare-snapshot.json`, `reports/labs.json`).

This page remains only to redirect old bookmarks.
