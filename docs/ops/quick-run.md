Use this when you need a fast, repeatable fix.

## Trigger
When a page fails to build, links break, or a checklist needs to be followed.

## Action
- Do the steps on the page you opened.
- Keep it to 3–5 bullets max per fix.

## Receipt
One line that proves it worked (e.g., build passes, link check passes).

## Stop rule
If it’s not fixed within 10 minutes, cut scope to the smallest fix and retry.

## Try it
- Run the 10-minute lab: [/labs/link-drift](/labs/link-drift)
