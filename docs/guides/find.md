## When to use it

- You're stuck and don't know which page applies
- You need a fix now, not a deep dive
- You're new here and want the shortest path

## Quick map

- **Fix a build or broken links** → [/ops/quick-run](/ops/quick-run) · [/labs/link-drift](/labs/link-drift)
- **Understand link integrity, then act** → [/guides/link-integrity](/guides/link-integrity)
- **See proof we're not hand-waving** → [/receipts/](/receipts/)

## Search tips

- Use the words you'd actually say out loud: "broken links," "build fails"
- If a page looks long, scroll to **Try it** first
