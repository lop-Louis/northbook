# Governance state · v2025.11

Keep the governance seam receipts obvious for this tag.
[Open the November release bundle](../../../ops/releases/2025-11/index.md) or [review the exceptions log](../exceptions.md).

## what changed

- Adopted the deep-embed North Star + four-bucket IA decision (dec-2025-11-ia-overhaul) and published the governing contract under docs/contracts.
- Seeded governance receipts and exception scaffolding so the guardrail chain stays linkable from CI and release tags.
- Proved `pnpm run docs:guard` cold-start at 3.736s (<= 5 min budget) on 11 Nov 2025 and logged the duration for audit.

## pending

- Wire CTA/tone lint to the autonomy ladder enforcement and surface exception IDs automatically in PR templates.
- Publish annex lab receipts once Navigate and Operate landing pilots finish (target 18 Nov 2025).

## risks/tripwires

- Freeze triggers fire if annex lab pass drops below 80% or time-to-answer worsens 20% vs baseline; monitoring via the signal registry.
- Exceptions older than 14 days auto-freeze; ledger automation not yet wired, so manual review happens every 3 days.

## next slice

- Ship the receipts panel on Navigate and Operate landings, then log receipts to the v2025.12-governance tag.
