# Decision Spine

What: Lightweight framework for making and documenting technical decisions in a repeatable, linkable way.
Why: Prevents re-litigation, makes tradeoffs explicit early, and leaves a durable paper trail for future teams.
When: Use for multi‑stakeholder choices, anything with meaningful tradeoffs, or answers you expect to paste more than twice.

## Four stages

1. **Frame** - What are we deciding? What constraints matter?
2. **Options** - What are 2-4 viable paths? What are the tradeoffs?
3. **Decide** - Who decides? When? What's the rationale?
4. **Review** - When do we revisit? What would trigger a change?

## Why use it

- Prevents "meeting amnesia" where decisions get re-litigated
- Makes tradeoffs explicit before emotions run high
- Creates a paper trail for future teams
- Speeds up recurring decision patterns

## Example template

```markdown
## Decision: [Short title]

### Frame

Problem: [What needs deciding]
Constraints: [Time, budget, skills, compliance]
Stakes: [What happens if we get this wrong]

### Options

**A. [Name]**
Pros: ...
Cons: ...
Effort: [S/M/L]

**B. [Name]**
Pros: ...
Cons: ...
Effort: [S/M/L]

### Decide

Choice: [A/B]
Decider: [Role or name]
Rationale: [Why this beats alternatives]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### Review

Next review: [Date or trigger]
Success metric: [What good looks like]
```

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Skipping the Frame and jumping to solutions
- ❌ Listing 10+ options (decision paralysis)
- ❌ No named decider (consensus trap)
- ❌ Never revisiting (sunk cost fallacy)

## Integration with other practices

Combine with:

- [Answer Ledger](./answer-ledger) for recurring questions
- [Facilitation](./facilitation) techniques for group decisions

See [Governance](./governance) for change types and the monthly release cadence.
