# Adopt deep-embed North Star + four-bucket IA with autonomy ladder

Make the deep-embed governance bet actionable for every seam.
[Open the IA overhaul contract](../contracts/northbook-ia-overhaul.md) or [review the governance state snapshot](../governance/state/v2025.11-governance.md).

## context

The site behaves like a content library: helpful but unable to prove value or protect tone. We're formalizing the operating model so guidance stays respectful, changes are traceable, and outcomes have receipts.

## decision

Adopt the **deep-embed** model: one North Star line visible on Home and each section landing; organize into **navigate, operate, learn, mitigate** buckets; enforce the **autonomy ladder** (nudge-first) and required page opener pattern (one-sentence why, two actions, exit metric).

- Tradeoffs:
  - Less copy freedom above the fold in exchange for clarity and measurability.
  - Added CI nudges now to avoid costly retrofits later.
  - One set of signals capped at eight, so some metrics won't make the cut.

## scope

**In:** all public Band-A pages and annex labs under navigate/operate/learn/mitigate; monthly seam-scoped tags `vyyyy.mm-<seam>`.  
**Out:** doc engine swaps, paid tooling, staffing changes.

## acceptance

- Every covered page renders the opener pattern above first section.
- Frontmatter required: `bucket, north_star_id, guardrail_id, owner, band, date, cta_primary_label, cta_secondary_label, leading_metric, lagging_metric`; add `decision_link` when scope/metrics change.
- Traceability complete: `pr <-> decision/exception <-> guardrail <-> page <-> signal <-> receipt` (no orphans).
- Signals registry seeded (<= 8 active, each with owner and 30-day SLA).
- Tone allow/ban lists applied; CTA labels pass lint.
- CI budget cold start <= 5 minutes; blocks only on red-lines and broken traceability.
- First seam landing pages shipped with tiny receipts panel.

## receipts (expected)

- **Leading:** `m-nav-open` up vs baseline; `m-lab-pass` >= 90% on pilot annex lab.
- **Lagging:** `m-time-to-answer` improves >= 10% in first 30 days; `m-decision-hit-rate` >= 60% by second tag.
- Attach receipts to `v2025.11-governance`, then monthly.

## freeze and exit

**Freeze triggers:** annex lab pass < 80%; time-to-answer worsens >= 20% vs baseline; exceptions older than 14 days.  
**Exit criteria:** owner identified; fix applied; proof metric back within 10% of baseline for 7 consecutive days; freeze lifted via noted exception close.
