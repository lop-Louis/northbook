# Northbook

Guidance over to-do. Northbook is a public VitePress site for Band A principles, patterns, and decisions—guidance you can link without dumping chores.

**Live Site:** https://northbook.guide

---

## What’s in the repo?

- **Guidance (`/docs`)** — VitePress content for principles, patterns, and decision aids. Subfolders track how automation scopes linting (e.g., `start-here/`, `playbook/`, `runbooks/`).
- **Runbooks (`/runbooks`)** — Legacy home for operational checklists; new runbooks live under `docs/runbooks/` so they render on the public site.
- **Guardrails (`/scripts`)** — Automation that stops drift, broken links, and unsanitized content.

Every published page declares its navigation placement via the `nav` array in frontmatter (e.g., `['main','sidebar']` for top nav and sidebar entries, `['none']` for hidden pages). `.vitepress/navigation.generated.ts` is generated from that metadata via `pnpm run nav:sync`, so the docs themselves stay the source of truth.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm run docs:dev

# Build for production
pnpm run docs:build

# Preview production build
pnpm run docs:preview

# One-shot validation
pnpm run validate
```

---

## Operating Model

- ✅ Only publishes **Band A** content (sanitized, public-safe).
- 🔐 Guardrails catch forbidden patterns, unreviewed changes, and missing metadata.
- 📅 Release rhythm documented in `/docs/monthly-release.md`.
- 🔗 Runbooks stay separate, but you can link back from `/docs`.

See `docs/principles.md` and [GOVERNANCE](./GOVERNANCE.md) for fuller details.
