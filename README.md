# Go-To Docs 📚

A public VitePress documentation site for Band A content (sanitized, public-safe practices and patterns).

**Live Site:** https://lop-Louis.github.io/go-to-docs

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run docs:dev

# Build for production
npm run docs:build

# Preview production build
npm run docs:preview
```

## What is This?

A self-policing documentation site that:
- ✅ Only publishes **Band A** content (no internal/sensitive data)
- 🤖 Automatically enforces sanitization rules via CI
- 📅 Tracks content staleness and auto-flags drift
- 🚀 Auto-merges green PRs, blocks red ones
- 🔗 Validates links and scans for secrets

See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for complete details.

## DevOps Setup

### GitHub Configuration

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
2. **Branch Protection:** Require Content Guard checks on `main`
3. **Labels:** Create `green`, `yellow`, `red`, `stale`, `automated`
4. **Optional:** Add `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` secret for analytics

### Acceptance Tests

- [x] Push to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages
- [x] PR with Band A violation is blocked
- [x] Valid PR auto-merges
- [x] Weekly stale report created
- [x] All tests pass: `npm test`

---

## Architecture

### CI/CD Workflows

1. **Pages** (`pages.yml`) - Deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main
2. **Content Guard** (`content-guard.yml`) - Validates PRs, auto-merges green
3. **Stale Pages** (`stale-pages.yml`) - Weekly audit on Mondays at 2 AM UTC
